Confirmed solely by astrophysical observations, it is clear that DM interacts with SM particles gravitationally, but the fundamental physics of how DM acts and interacts is unknown<sup>2</sup>. Structure formation is linked to the properties of DM, and relatedly, the true nature of DM can be studied by observing the imprints it leaves on cosmic structures<sup>3</sup>. With my research, I will create numerical simulations to forecast DM imprints on cosmological data.</p> <p>The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm theorizes the behavior of DM that only gravitationally in- teracts, and thus does not include particle interactions<sup>4</sup>. This paradigm predicts DM halos of varying sizes, from larger than galactic cluster sized halos, to sub-Earth sized halos. Once DM theories include non-gravitational interaction, small scale structures can be suppressed or enhanced depending on the type of DM-SM interaction<sup>4</sup>. For the most well-known particle DM theory, the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) paradigm, DM-SM interactions suppress structure formation below stellar-mass sized halos. Observing small scale structures therefore provides a key opportunity to probe the validity of par- ticle DM theories, and test whether DM interactions are purely gravitational. My research will focus on the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) DM particle theory, which is the leading particle DM paradigm<sup>5</sup>. Theorists have been able to forecast the matter signature of DM halos for a variety of mass scales. One particular mass scale, the sub stellar mass scale, includes matter signature forecasts for both WIMPs and CDM. Through simulating the DM halo formation for sub stellar mass scales utilizing the physics described in both the CDM and WIMPs paradigm, I will be able to forecast observables that will be used to analyze the upcoming data from the new upcoming state of the art cosmological experiments.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#previous-research","title":"Previous Research","text":""},{"location":"reasearch/#studying-the-galactic-center-excess-with-prof-tracy-slatyer","title":"Studying the Galactic Center Excess with Prof. Tracy Slatyer","text":"<p>From September 2019 to March 2021, I worked with Professor Tracy Slatyer in MIT\u2019s Center of Theoretical Physics.

My research focused on understanding possible systematic errors in the non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF) method which is used to identify unresolved point sources, which is a theorized source of the GCE.
