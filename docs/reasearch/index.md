## Current Research: What is a dark matter?
One of the open questions in particle physics and cosmology is the nature of Dark Matter (DM),
which comprises 85% of the Universe’s matter budget and cannot be described by any particles in the
Standard Model (SM) [@drlicawagner2022reporttopicalgroupcosmic]. Confirmed solely by astrophysical observations, it is clear that DM interacts
with SM particles gravitationally, but the fundamental physics of how DM acts and interacts is unknown[@Audren_2014]. Structure formation is linked to the properties of DM, and relatedly, the true nature of DM can be studied by observing the imprints it leaves on cosmic structures[@An_2022]. With my
research, I will create numerical simulations to forecast DM imprints on cosmological data.

The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm theorizes the behavior of DM that only gravitationally in-
teracts, and thus does not include particle interactions[@bechtol2023snowmass2021cosmicfrontierwhite]. This paradigm predicts DM halos of varying
sizes, from larger than galactic cluster sized halos, to sub-Earth sized halos. Once DM theories include
non-gravitational interaction, small scale structures can be suppressed or enhanced depending on the type
of DM-SM interaction[@bechtol2023snowmass2021cosmicfrontierwhite]. For the most well-known particle DM theory, the weakly interacting massive
particle (WIMP) paradigm, DM-SM interactions suppress structure formation below stellar-mass sized
halos. Observing small scale structures therefore provides a key opportunity to probe the validity of par-
ticle DM theories, and test whether DM interactions are purely gravitational. My research will focus on
the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) DM particle theory, which is the leading particle DM
paradigm[@Dodelson_1994]. Theorists have been able to forecast the matter signature of DM halos for a variety of mass
scales. One particular mass scale, the sub stellar mass scale, includes matter signature forecasts for both
WIMPs and CDM. Through simulating the DM halo formation for sub stellar mass scales utilizing the
physics described in both the CDM and WIMPs paradigm, I will be able to forecast observables that will
be used to analyze the upcoming data from the new upcoming state of the art cosmological experiments.

## Previous Research

### Studying the Galactic Center Excess with Prof. Tracy Slatyer
From September 2019 to March 2021, I worked with Professor Tracy Slatyer in MIT’s Center of
Theoretical Physics. There, I explored dark matter interaction with gamma-radiation in the
Galactic Center Excess (GCE), a region of excess gamma-ray radiation. My research focused on
understanding possible systematic errors in the non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF)
method which is used to identify unresolved point sources, which is a theorized source of the
GCE. Through analyzing model dependence on background models, I showed that NPTF was
biased towards the diffuse background model of NPTF.

### Modeling Peak Luminosity of Binary Black Hole Mergers using Machine Learning
In the summer of 2019, I participated in the LIGO SURF program, a summer REU hosted by
LIGO and Caltech. I worked with Prof. Vijay Varma to create a data-driven model for the peak
luminosity of black hole mergers. I utilized the black hole merger simulations developed by the
SXS collaboration within LIGO and created a surrogate model based on Gaussian Process
Regression, a machine learning technique. More information can be found on my publication [page](../publications/highlights/awesome_paper/index.md).

### Analyzing Sagittarius B2, a molecular gas cloud

From the summer of 2018 to the summer of 2019, I worked with Professor Kerstin Perez and
Professor Shuo Zhang at MIT. My work focused on the source of the hard X-ray flux from
Sagittarius B2, a dense molecular cloud in the galactic center. This project required me to
conduct analysis with the NuSTAR pipeline, the analytical pipeline for the hard X-ray telescope,
which taught me how to quickly adopt and understand a scientific analysis pipeline. Results can be found on my publication [page](../publications/highlights/large_mwl_paper/index.md).
