# New Constraints on Cosmic Particle Populations at the Galactic Center using X-ray Observations of the Molecular Cloud Sagittarius B2

In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13399), we constrained the source dependence of Sagittarius B2 flux from Low Energy Cosmic Rays (LECRs) using data from [XMM Newton](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton) and [NuSTAR](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nuclear-spectroscopic-telescope-array-nustar/). We showed that the 2018 emission is consistent with the theory that Sagittarius B2's flux is primarily due to X-ray reprocessing.
