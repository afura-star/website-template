# Are Flowers Not the Stars of the Earth? -Clara Lucas Balfour

Flowers are beautiful, and I love beautiful things! In particular, tulips are my favorite given their wide array of colors and peculiar shape. When I lived in Roxbury, I planted some tulips and was delighted when they bloomed! Here are some images from the brief but gorgeous tulip season of 2021.
